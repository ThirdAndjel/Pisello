Create an approximate timer called Pisello (pea) similar to pomodoro.

With a pomodoro-type timer a person could start stressing knowing the that their time is running out, or could start procrastinating towards the end of the timer reducing their work. An approximate timer would emulate another person telling them to stop at an approximate/slightly unexpected time. (more human less machine-like).                                           


fill bucket with pea pods
pick pea pod, randomize number of peas inside
count peas inside
  if peas > 0 then remove one pea
  wait 1 second? and count again
    else pick new pea pod 
when finished cleaning peas in bucket
start on next bucket

When finished with all buckets
  alert user



What does success look like

Pisello v.1: After cleaning the specified amount of buckets, Pisello will return a meme (more visible). Pisello can then be rerun.

Pisello v.2: Will allow user to choose amount of buckets (three choices), Pisello will not restart until a specified break time has passed, automate restart of Pisello?

Pisello v.3: Will use audio files for messages when choosing amount of buckets (relief?complain), and when finished (exuberation/complain), or when trying to restart Pisello (will complain if break time is not finished). User should be able to choose who will clean peas (voice files from everyone in class/group). Animate peas being cleaned while Pisello is running?
