Pisello - A pomodoro style pea counting app

	Like a Pomodoro, Pisello will time work sessions and break sessions. Pisellos are measured in buckets, pea pods and peas, instead of minutes and seconds. Just like peas in a pod, Pisellos vary in time slightly every run.

	With a Pomodoro type timer, a person could start stressing, knowing that their time is running out or could start procrastinating towards the end of the timer, reducing their productivity. An approximate timer would emulate another person telling them to stop at an approximate/slightly unexpected time (more human, less machine-like).

	Pisello v.1: Single .rb that runs once, and must be started again to perform another Pisello. This version will provide near 20 minutes of work, and near 5 minutes of break. A visual indication of bucket/pea pod/pea counting will be displayed.

	Pisello v.2: The user will be able to specify how long the work session and break should be in a Pisello. Another Pisello can be started without exiting the app. The number of Pisellos performed will be tracked.

	Pisello v.3: Pisello will now provide audio reminders to tell the user when it is time to break and start work again.

	-Create the application through test driven development.
	-This is our first time working together, so focus on teamwork.
	-Take turns driving and navigating.
	-All research will be done as a group.
	-Review our teamwork after version 1 of the program.
	-All research to be placed on 3x5 note cards.
	-Review individual strengths and weaknesses.
	-Review what we think we are (Driver/Navigator).
	-Each team member able to manage project through Github.
